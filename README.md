# The-Game-of-Congo
Game dynamics Congo consists of two players, Black and White, who take turns moving (no skipping of turns is allowed). White starts first. The aim of the game is to capture the opponent’s lion—the game is immediately over when one player’s lion has been captured. Players take turns making moves and potentially capturing their opponent’s pieces. If a player moves to a square that is occupied by an opposing piece, that piece is said to be captured and is removed from the board. In Congo, as in chess, a player is not allowed to capture their own pieces, so moving to a square occupied by one’s own piece is prohibited.
